## Description

I'm learning Perl for work, and always catch on quicker when I have to look up things I don't know as I'm building something practical...and what better way to learn a new programming language than by making a command line game!  I'm still figuring out best practices, proper use cases, and general syntax.  But this was a lot of fun to create.  Enjoy!~
